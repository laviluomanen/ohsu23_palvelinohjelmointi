# ohsu23_palvelinpohjelmointi
* This is mandatory work done for Palvelinohjelmointi course during SeAMK's OHSU23 studies.
* The service is an event register which allows user to store events and categorize them.
* Users can be added to the system, but no segmentation exists yet in terms of visibility.
* Basic authentication is available, but /users is permitted to everyone.
* Not built by me from Scratch. Built on top of one Mooc.fi Web-palvelinohjelmointi course excercise.
